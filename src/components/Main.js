            I have around 3 years commercial experience in HTML, CSS and JS. I
            learnt to code at Northcoders in 2018 and have since worked both in
            house and for digital agencies.

          <p>
            My prefered tech stack is React with a focus on site performance and
            slick looking UX. I also get excited about CRO, accessibility and
            agile processes.

            If you'd like to see examples of my work, you can take a look at my
            GitHub and Codepen.
