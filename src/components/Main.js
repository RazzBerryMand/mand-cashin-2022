        <p>
          I have around 3 years commercial experience in HTML, CSS and JS. I
          learnt to code at Northcoders in 2018 and have since worked both in
          house and for digital agencies.

          My prefered tech stack is React with a focus on site performance and
          slick looking UX. I also get excited about CRO, accessibility and
          agile processes.
