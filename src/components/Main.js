        <p>
          I have roughly 3 years of commercial HTML, CSS, and JS experience. In
          2018, I learned to code at Northcoders and have since worked in-house
          and for digital agencies.

          React is my preferred tech stack, with an emphasis on site performance
          and a smooth user experience. CRO, accessibility, and agile processes
          also excite me.
